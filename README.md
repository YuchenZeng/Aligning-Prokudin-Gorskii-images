Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin-Gorsky was a Russian chemist and photographer. He is known for his pioneering work in colour photography and his effort to document early 20th-century Russia. Using a railroad-car darkroom provided by Tsar Nicholas II, Prokudin-Gorsky traveled the Russian Empire from around 1909 to 1915 using his three-image colour photography to record its many aspects.
